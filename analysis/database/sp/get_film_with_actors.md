# Procedure Summary: DEMO.get_film_with_actors

## Description
This procedure retrieves information about a specific film and its associated actors based on the provided film ID.

## Business Rules
- The procedure takes a film ID as input and returns a result set containing the film's details and the actors who appeared in that film.

## Data Interaction Details
- The procedure joins the `film`, `film_actor`, and `actor` tables to retrieve the required information.
- It uses the input parameter `p_film_id` to filter the results based on the specified film ID.

## Parameters
- `p_film_id` (IN): The ID of the film for which the details and actors need to be retrieved.
- `p_cursor` (OUT): A reference cursor that will hold the result set containing the film and actor information.

## Code Metrics
- Lines of code: 14
- Number of cursors: 1 (p_cursor)
- Number of exception blocks: 0

## Logic Structure
1. The procedure starts with the `BEGIN` keyword.
2. It opens the `p_cursor` for a SELECT statement.
3. The SELECT statement joins the `film`, `film_actor`, and `actor` tables based on the film ID and actor ID relationships.
4. The WHERE clause filters the results based on the provided `p_film_id`.
5. The procedure ends with the `END` keyword.

## Nested Elements
- There are no nested elements in this procedure.

## Dependencies
- The procedure depends on the `film`, `film_actor`, and `actor` tables.
