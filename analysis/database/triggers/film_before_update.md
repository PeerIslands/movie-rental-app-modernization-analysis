# Description
The provided code is a database trigger named `DEMO.film_before_update`. It is triggered before an update operation is performed on the `film` table.

# Business Rules
The trigger ensures that whenever a row in the `film` table is updated, the `last_update` column of the modified row is automatically set to the current date.

# Data Interaction Details
The trigger operates on the `film` table and modifies the `last_update` column of the row being updated.

# Parameters
The trigger does not have any explicit parameters. It implicitly uses the `:NEW` pseudo-record to access and modify the values of the row being updated.

# Code Metrics
- Lines of code: 5
- Number of cursors: 0
- Number of exception blocks: 0

# Logic Structure
The trigger has a simple logic structure. It consists of a single `BEGIN` block that assigns the current date to the `last_update` column of the `:NEW` pseudo-record.

# Nested Elements
The trigger does not contain any nested elements.

# Dependencies
The trigger depends on the `film` table and the `current_date` function provided by the database system.

# Overview
The `DEMO.film_before_update` trigger is a simple trigger that automatically updates the `last_update` column of the `film` table with the current date whenever a row is modified. This ensures that the `last_update` column always reflects the most recent update timestamp for each row in the `film` table.
