# Description
This is a database trigger named `DEMO.film_before_trigger` that is executed before an INSERT operation on the `film` table. The trigger performs the following actions:

1. If the `film_id` column of the new row being inserted is NULL, it assigns the next value from the `film_sequence` sequence to the `film_id` column.
2. It sets the `last_update` column of the new row to the current date.

# Business Rules
- Each new film inserted into the `film` table must have a unique `film_id` value.
- The `last_update` column should be automatically set to the current date whenever a new film is inserted.

# Data Interaction Details
- The trigger is executed before each row is inserted into the `film` table.
- It checks the value of the `film_id` column for the new row being inserted.
- If the `film_id` is NULL, it retrieves the next value from the `film_sequence` sequence and assigns it to the `film_id` column.
- It updates the `last_update` column of the new row with the current date.

# Parameters
The trigger does not have any explicit parameters. However, it uses the `:NEW` pseudo-record to access the values of the new row being inserted.

# Code Metrics
- Lines of code: 9
- Number of cursors: 0
- Number of exception blocks: 0

# Logic Structure
1. Check if the `film_id` column of the new row is NULL.
2. If `film_id` is NULL:
   - Retrieve the next value from the `film_sequence` sequence.
   - Assign the next value to the `film_id` column of the new row.
3. Set the `last_update` column of the new row to the current date.

# Nested Elements
The trigger does not contain any nested elements.

# Dependencies
- The trigger depends on the existence of the `film` table.
- It also depends on the `film_sequence` sequence for generating unique `film_id` values.

# Overview
The `DEMO.film_before_trigger` is a database trigger that ensures the uniqueness of the `film_id` column and automatically sets the `last_update` column to the current date whenever a new film is inserted into the `film` table. It helps maintain data integrity and consistency by enforcing business rules related to film insertion.
