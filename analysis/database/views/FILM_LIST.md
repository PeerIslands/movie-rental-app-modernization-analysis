## Business Rules
The view follows the following business rules:
- Each film is associated with a category.

- `film_actor`: Establishes the relationship between films and actors.
- `actor`: Contains information about actors.

The view performs the following joins:
- Left join between `category` and `film_category` tables based on the `category_id` column.
- Left join between `film_category` and `film` tables based on the `film_id` column.
- Inner join between `film` and `film_actor` tables based on the `film_id` column.
- Inner join between `film_actor` and `actor` tables based on the `actor_id` column.
